```


## Project objectives

This project looks at syndesmophyte growth data for `r length(unique(cleaned_dat$ID))` individuals 
over `r length(unique(cleaned_dat$Spine))` spinal joints and its association with proximity to the 
aorta. The computed distances from the aorta to each 5^o^ segment of the joint is also provided.

The basic hypothesis is that proximity to the aorta suppresses growth, so we would expect the growth
in the sectors closest to the aorta to be the least, and the growth there would be present less often. A 
secondary question involves the association of the presence of growth with proximity to the aorta.
