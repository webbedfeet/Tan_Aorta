#' The paper reviews promoted an idea of modeling with the "complete cohort". We are
#' interpreting that to mean that we want to provide overall p-values showing that the effect
#' of the aorta on syndesmophyte formation (by showing that overall the nadir sector has
#' the lowest height of syndesmophytes) exists, rather than being uniform.
#'
#' A couple of ideas will be tried.
#'
#' 1. Show an upward trend in syndesmophyte heights moving away from the nadir sector, and
#'    that any other ordering of the sectors would not show a generally increasing pattern
#' 2. Model the avg heights and/or the presence of syndesmophytes on location using a
#'    repeated mea
